       <details><summary>where is Arba Minch?</summary><p > Arba Minch (formerly called
          Ganta Garo) is a city and separate woreda in the southern part of Ethiopia. 
         "Arba Minch" means "40 Springs", originated from the presence of more than 40 springs.
          It is located in the Gamo Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region
           about 500 kilometers south of Addis Ababa, at an elevation of 1285 meters
          above sea level. It is the largest town in Gamo Zone and the second town in
          SNNPR next to Hawassa, which is now the capital city of the newly formed 
          Sidama Region. It is surrounded by Arba Minch Zuria woreda. This Town has
          plenty of natural gifts including the bridge of God, Crocodile ranch,
           crocodile market, different fruits and vegetables, different fishes farmed from Chamo and Abaya Lakes, 
           more than 40 springs, different cereals, and crops, surprisingly having the two
